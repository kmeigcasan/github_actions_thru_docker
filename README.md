# tdd-fairness-app-assignment

# VERY IMPORTANT
After you download this app, make sure you run **npm install** FIRST in your local machine to install the dependencies before you run any docker commands.

This simple app will just be a single function that accepts 2 values. Build this app in TDD approach.
**You must write the test first, have it failed, then write the necessary code for it to pass**

1. This function must only accept 2 arguments (should be not okay if function is passed with a single argument or more than 2 arguments)
2. It will return a success message if 2 values are equal
3. It will return a fail message if 2 values are not equal
4. It will return an error message if 2 values are not numbers.

# Important

1. Write a single test first (for example for #1), see the test fail, write the code for the test to pass, see the test pass.
2. Then proceed to the other features.

# Instructions

1. For now, just write the Fairness App function directly in the test file.
2. Make sure you work on this assignment in a docker container. The necessarily files to build and run this app in a docker container is already provided.
3. Once done, you need to zip your app in one file and upload the zipped file in Hacker Hero.
